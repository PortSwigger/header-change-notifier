Header Change Notifier is a professional Burp Suite extension designed to monitor and detect changes in HTTP response headers. As headers change between requests made to the same URL, an alert is triggered. This extension is an excellent tool for security researchers, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters who actively seek to identify security misconfigurations via header changes.

To configure settings, click on the Settings tab within the extension. Users can check or uncheck headers they want to monitor and add custom headers using the input field. Click on Save Settings to apply these changes.

To export results, select the Export CSV button in the Header Changes tab, choose your desired save location, and save. The CSV exported contains all detected changes along with timestamps and risk levels. 

This extension can find application in different scenarios such as security testing, bug bounty hunting, development testing, compliance monitoring, and red team operations.
